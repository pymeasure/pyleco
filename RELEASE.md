# Release workflow

## PyPI

1. Draft a new release on github with a new tag (create on publish) in the style `vMajor.Minor.Patch`, where `Major`, `Minor`, and `Patch` are integers according to semnatic versioning
1. Use the autogenerated changelog to update `CHANGELOG.md` in main
   * helpful regex: `in (https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco/pull/)(\d+)` to `([#$2]($1$2))`
1. Update the version and release date in `CITATION.cff`
1. Commit the aforementioned changes
1. Copy the modified changelog from the file to the github release draft
1. Release the new version on github
1. Approve the release run in the actions tab
1. Verify that the upload to PyPI succeeded


## Conda-forge

1. Do the PyPI release first
1. Update the conda-forge repository with the version and checksum of the tar.gz archive of that tag:
   * On Linux use `openssl sha256 pyleco-1.2.3.tar.gz` (adjust the version)
   * On windows use `certUtil -hashfile pyleco-1.2.3.tar.gz SHA256` (adjust the version) to generate the SHA256 hash
1. Make sure to rerender the feedstock repository during the PR
