# PyLECO
Python reference implementation of the Laboratory Experiment COntrol (LECO) protocol (https://github.com/pymeasure/leco-protocol).

The [reviewed branch](https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco/tree/reviewed) contains reviewed code, which does not yet contain all necessary modules and classes.
The most recent development is in the [main branch](https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco/tree/main).

Note: LECO is still under development, such that the code and API might change.
